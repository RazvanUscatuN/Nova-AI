""" 
Creating Nova, ai assitant that focus on being a personal assistant or teacher (for the moment)
The main logic for this AI: capture sound from mic, converting into text, process the text and respond trough LLM,
voice the respond
Factors that I am looking for: speed, accurate repsonses, natural voice
Features(maybe future): memory, pre-load info,  setting reminders
Others: using open sources ideas, runnig llm locally as a test.
This project is focusing on learning, testing and breaking stuff until it works

# 3 main logic pillars

# I. Capture 
# II. Process
# III. Deliver


# I. Capture
# Focus on capturing the sound from the mic, converting into text  with whisper









# II. Process
# The text response is feed into a local LLM and produce a respond in a text back










# III. Deliver
# The response from the LLM is voices through a AI voice. Focus is on natural voice as much as posible.
# Try with open source, if not the big tech ai voices altenative
